# ONNX Profile Topology Mapping Proposal
Author: Ofer Rosenberg, Milan Oljaca

Version: 0.1

## Introduction

A part of the Edge working group charter is to define a set of profiles for edge devices. The goal is for an edge device to be tested for compliance with a set of profiles. 
During the working group discussions turned out that there can be a few approaches to breaking down of the edge devices functionality space. 
Intent with such profile breakdown is to establish categorization of edge profiles based on use cases and profile attributes identified in [onnx-edge-scope-and-profile-definition.md](https://github.com/onnx/working-groups/blob/master/edge/artifacts/onnx-edge-scope-and-profile-definition.md) document.
The goal of this document is to describe the few possible ways to do the topology mapping, and drive towards deciding on one of these. 
There are two decisions that need to be made :
1. Define 3-level topology or 2-level topology
2. Define the mapping type (sensor based, network based, etc.)

## Topology Level

In defining the profiles, we can take two approaches :
1. A three-level topology mapping, where the top level categories are identified as per [Scope of Edge.png](https://github.com/onnx/working-groups/blob/master/edge/artifacts/Scope%20of%20Edge.png).
   1. First level  : Edge Infrastructure, Edge Device
   1. Second level : Based on mapping type (see next section)
   1. Third level  : Complexity (Basic / Intermediate / Advanced)
2. A two-level topology mapping. Instead of top level categories, roll it into more complexity levels
   1. First level  : Based on mapping type (see next section)
   1. Second level : Complexity (1-N)


## Mapping Type

In defining the mapping type, we suggest the following two approaches :
1. Based on Sensor type : 2D Image, Audio, Voice, Text, ...
2. Based on Network type : Classification, SSD, Image Reconstruction, Speech Recognition, ...

## Selection Criteria: 

The selection criteria between the various mapping options will focus on 
1. Defining a set of profiles which covers the range of target devices
2. Creating a clear profile definition that will serve for compliance purpose
